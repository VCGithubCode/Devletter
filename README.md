## Devletter - Newsletter for Developer's

A beautiful Newletter website made with Nextjs.

![Demo] (https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/projectfriendz-45b49.appspot.com/o/images%2Fbanner2.png?alt=media&token=c96ca45b-6abf-4ff9-972d-217d89ab4d65)

The site is implemented with beautiful template of thankyou email for the user who join.. But now in live it would not send you welcome email because it is hosted on vercel and render required verified domains.. 

So to test thankyou email feature, clone it and don't forget to add your `RESEND_API_KEY` in .env file

### Tech stack : 
1. Nextjs,
2. Typescript,
3. Tailwindscc
4. serverAction
5. ReactForm
6. Render (for email)
7. React-email (for email template)
8. ...

## Clone it with few steps

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
